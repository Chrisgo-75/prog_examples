# Update Oracle Instant Client

## Questions
	
	Q: What Oracle gems are being used in cals_db_sync application?
		gem 'ruby-oci8'
			* https://www.rubydoc.info/github/kubo/ruby-oci8
			* https://github.com/kubo/ruby-oci8
		gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~> 1.6.0'
			* https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced

## Steps

1. Before doing anything, make sure connection to Campus Oracle data-view works from cals_db_sync application:
	a. cd to cals_db_sync application/current directory.
	b. $ RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails console
	c. > x = Epm::Queries.retrieve_uwbnemailaddr_for_emplid('<empl_id_here>')
		 => #<ActiveRecord::Result:0x0000000004cbba98 @columns=["emplid", "uw_bn_email_addr"], @rows=[["<empl_id>", "c----------.----t@w---.edu"]], @hash_rows=nil, @column_types={}> 
	d. Successful connection.

2. Download zip packages

	Grab the URL's to the zip files:
	https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-oci8/file/docs/install-instant-client.md
		> https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html
			> https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html

	On server in /usr/lib/oracle/ directory run the below commands:
		sudo wget https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/185000/instantclient-basic-linux.x64-18.5.0.0.0dbru.zip
		sudo wget https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/185000/instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-18.5.0.0.0dbru.zip
		sudo wget https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/185000/instantclient-sqlplus-linux.x64-18.5.0.0.0dbru.zip
	
3. Unzip zip packages

	# May need unzip package
	sudo apt-get install unzip
	
	# 1st
	sudo unzip instantclient-basic-linux.x64-18.5.0.0.0dbru.zip
	# 2nd
	sudo unzip instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-18.5.0.0.0dbru.zip
	# 3rd
	sudo unzip instantclient-sqlplus-linux.x64-18.5.0.0.0dbru.zip
	
	# FYI. unzipping the 2nd and 3rd packages put their files within "instantclient_18_5" directory that was auto-created in unzipping 1st package.

4. Did not need to do this step since the symbolic link "libclntsh.so" exists and was pointing to "libclntsh.so.18.1".

	If /usr/lib/oracle/instantclient_18_5/libclntsh.so is not found, make a symbolic link to link the library.

	cd /usr/lib/oracle/instantclient_18_5
	sudo ln -s libclntsh.so.18.1 libclntsh.so

5. Within (/usr/lib/oracle/instantclient_18_5) directory

	# sqlplus will more than likely require libaio package, so install that dependency.
	# From https://apextips.blogspot.com/2019/09/installing-oracle-instant-client-on.html
	sudo apt-get install libaio1

6. Define LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	(Did not use this approach) To define this variable, simply use (on the shell prompt):
		$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/instantclient_18_5
		$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
		
		Side Note: below site says to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH to apache's (/etc/apache2/envvars)
					http://www.thesatya.com/blog/2010/02/
		
	Used this approach which was done in previous installations.
		# To make it permanent, you can edit the ldconfig files.
		cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d
		# open /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf file (create it if file doesn't exist) and put in the directory of where you put the Oracle files:
		sudo vim oracle.conf
		# and the file contains one line (below)
		/usr/lib/oracle/instantclient_18_5
		# Update Dynamic Linker Run-Time Bindings or Cache
		# resource => https://serverfault.com/questions/201709/how-to-set-ld-library-path-in-ubuntu
		sudo ldconfig

7. Test out ...

	Rename folder to make sure it is NOT being referenced when conducting Oracle Connection Test.
	$ sudo mv instantclient_11_2 old_instantclient_11_2
		Rename folder back.
		$ sudo mv old_instantclient_11_2 instantclient_11_2

	Oracle Connection Test ---failed--- due to unable to "build" console to run tests in...
	a. cd to cals_db_sync application/current directory.
	b. $ RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails console
	c. > x = Epm::Queries.retrieve_uwbnemailaddr_for_emplid('<empl_id_here>')

	In trying to (bin/rails console), I get the below load error
	ruby-2.3.6-rg276@cals_db_sync ~/apps/cals_db_sync/current $ RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails console
	/home/ruby_193/apps/cals_db_sync/shared/bundle/ruby/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-4.2.5.1/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:274:in `require': libclntsh.so.11.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - /home/ruby_193/apps/cals_db_sync/shared/bundle/ruby/2.3.0/gems/ruby-oci8-2.2.4.1/lib/oci8lib_230.so (LoadError)

	To fix
	VBox VM
		$ gem uninstall activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter
			=> Successfully uninstalled activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter-1.6.9
		$ gem uninstall ruby-oci8
			=> Successfully uninstalled ruby-oci8-2.2.4.1
		Note: it is "ruby-oci8" that re-does the "link" to the updated Oracle InstantClient version.
		$ bundle
			***or*** 
			gem install activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter
			gem install ruby-oci8
	Rails Server
		$ bundle exec gem uninstall ruby-oci8
		$ bundle

	Oracle Connection Test 
	a. cd to cals_db_sync application/current directory.
	b. $ RAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails console
	c. > x = Epm::Queries.retrieve_uwbnemailaddr_for_emplid('<empl_id_here>')
		=> outputted data successfully.
